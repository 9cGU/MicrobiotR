# MicroBiotR: A Comprehensive R Toolkit for SOM-Based Microbiota Flow Cytometry and Downstream Machine Learning

## Overview

SIAMCAT is a comprehensive pipeline designed for **Statistical Inference of Associations between Microbial Communities And host phenoTypes**. It provides a robust framework for analyzing microbiome data to determine changes in community composition that are associated with environmental factors and host phenotypes. [cite_start]This tool is crucial for linking human microbiome composition to host phenotypes, such as diseases, which is an area of intense research.

## Key Features

MicrobiotR provide an All-in-One framework that supports a wide array of microbiota flow cytometry clustering and analysis, including:
* **MBR_som**: Preparing your raw microbiome data for analysis.
* **MBR_stat**: Identifying significant associations between microbial communities and host phenotypes.
* **MBR_circle**: Utilizing advanced models like LASSO logistic regression for predictive analysis.
* **MBR_ml**: Providing tools for cross-validation, parameter selection, ROC analysis, and diagnostic model plots to evaluate and interpret the generated models.
* **MBR_conf**: A toolkit for extracting relevant biomarkers from your microbiome data.
