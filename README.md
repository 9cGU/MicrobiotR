# SIAMCAT: Statistical Inference of Associations between Microbial Communities And host phenoTypes

## Overview

[cite_start]SIAMCAT is a comprehensive pipeline designed for **Statistical Inference of Associations between Microbial Communities And host phenoTypes**. [cite_start]It provides a robust framework for analyzing microbiome data to determine changes in community composition that are associated with environmental factors and host phenotypes. [cite_start]This tool is crucial for linking human microbiome composition to host phenotypes, such as diseases, which is an area of intense research.

## Key Features

SIAMCAT offers a full pipeline that supports various stages of microbiome data analysis, including:
* [cite_start]**Data Preprocessing**: Preparing your raw microbiome data for analysis.
* [cite_start]**Statistical Association Testing**: Identifying significant associations between microbial communities and host phenotypes.
* [cite_start]**Statistical Modeling**: Utilizing advanced models like LASSO logistic regression for predictive analysis.
* [cite_start]**Model Evaluation & Interpretation**: Providing tools for cross-validation, parameter selection, ROC analysis, and diagnostic model plots to evaluate and interpret the generated models.
* [cite_start]**Biomarker Extraction**: A toolkit for extracting relevant biomarkers from your microbiome data.

## Availability

SIAMCAT is versatile and available in three convenient forms to suit different user needs:
* [cite_start]**Galaxy web server**: For users who prefer a graphical interface.
* [cite_start]**Command line tool**: For integration into existing bioinformatics workflows and scripting.
* [cite_start]**R package**: For R users who wish to leverage SIAMCAT's functionalities within the R environment.
