# MicroBiotR: A Comprehensive R Toolkit for SOM-Based Microbiota Flow Cytometry and Downstream Machine Learning

## Overview

MicroBiotR is a comprehensive R pipeline developed for analysis between microbiota And host phenotype such as HC vs disease. The package delivers a robust framework for examining microbiota flowcytometry, aiming to pinpoint difference of bacterial community composition potentially linked to environmental factors and host phenotypes.

## Key Features

MicrobiotR provide an All-in-One framework that supports a wide array of microbiota flow cytometry clustering and analysis, including:
* **MBR_som**: Preparing your raw microbiome data for analysis.
* **MBR_stat**: Identifying significant associations between microbial communities and host phenotypes.
* **MBR_circle**: Utilizing advanced models like LASSO logistic regression for predictive analysis.
* **MBR_ml**: Providing tools for cross-validation, parameter selection, ROC analysis, and diagnostic model plots to evaluate and interpret the generated models.
* **MBR_conf**: A toolkit for extracting relevant biomarkers from your microbiome data.
